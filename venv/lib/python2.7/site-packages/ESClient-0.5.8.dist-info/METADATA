====================================
WARNING: There is an official client
====================================
ElasticSearch now has an official Python API. For new projects, I strongly recommend you to use it.

You can install the official API with:
    $ easy_install elasticsearch

Check out http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/python-api/current/index.html for more info.

========
ESClient
========
ESClient is a Python library that uses the ElasticSearch REST API. It is meant
to be lightweight and be *close to the actual REST API* in terms of usage.

With ESClient comes two scripts that are installed in your /usr/local/bin:

* esdump -- Use this script to dump one or more indexes to a file (or stdout)

* esimport -- Use this script to import a dump

The only shortage with these two tools is that they do not make a backup of the
mappings yet. This is however planned for an upcoming version.

Installation
============

To install::

    python setup.py install

You can also install ESClient with easy_install or pip.
The following commands will install the latest released version of ESClient::

  $ easy_install esclient

Or with pip::

  $ pip install esclient

Usage
=====
Please take a look at the test_esclient.py file for usage examples. This code
at least covers all the API methods that are implemented.
As soon as the API reaches stability I will put more time into writing decent
documentation. I advice you to keep the ElasticSearch documentation at hand
when you start using this library. The documentation strings in the code
should be very useful.

Unit tests
==========
test_esclient.py can be used for unit testing. You can directly run this file
if you have an ElasticSearch instance running on localhost.

Bug Tracker and Issues
======================
If you find a bug or any other issue you may create an issue on GitHub!

Roadmap / TODO
==============
My target is to reach a stable 1.0 release. Currently on the roadmap to reach
such a 1.0 release are:

* Implementing most or even all the API methods
* Adding support for backing up the mappings with esdump and esimport
* Adding option to esdump to save data into multiple files, with names based 
  on the name of the source index

Credits
=======
This client library was written by Erik-Jan van Baaren (erikjan@gmail.com)
Others have contributed bugfixes or extensions too (thanks!)
The style of this library is inspired by `pyelasticsearch`_.

Dependencies
============
* ESClient uses the excellent *requests* library.
* The unit tests only work on Python 2.7 (one test will fail on 2.6)
* The code is tested mostly on Python 2.6 and 2.7

Changelog
=========
0.5.5
-----
* Added esdump script, which can dump indexes to a (optionally compressed) file or stdout
  by using the new scan and scroll methods

0.5.4
-----
* Added two methods: scan and scroll. With these methods you can now perform
  scan queries and scroll through the results.

0.5.3
-----
* Bugfixing

0.5.2
-----
* fixed an issue where the dependency on the requests library was
  not automatically procesed by easy_install / pip

0.5.1
-----
* Refactored the bulk API to use more standard methods from ESClient
* fixed some typos in code

0.5.0
-----
* Added bulk API + unit tests (thanks to isnowfy)

0.4.0
-----
* Added API method: index_exists

0.3.0
-----
* Better error handling (by using _parse_json_response() method everywhere)
* Added API methods: get_mapping, put_mapping

0.2.1
-----
* Added API methods: status, flush
* some code improvements / beautifying

0.2.0
-----
* Removed option to choose between JSON or hierachy of Python objects. It
  would have created too much hassle.
* Added API methods: mget, open+close index, create_alias, delete_alias
* small fixes here and there

0.1.1
-----
* Added docstring to the get API
* made sure that makedist.sh removes old MANIFEST file before making new
  package
* fixed version string in esclient.py


0.1.0
-----
>From now on I will conform to the Semantic Versioning Guidelines outlined
on this site: http://semver.org/
In that spirit, I bumped the minor version to 0.1.0 and will keep doing so
until public API stability is reached.

0.0.1
-----
First official release that was published to PyPI. Alpha quality, but with
working unit tests for each API method.
